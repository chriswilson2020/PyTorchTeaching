They can have any number of dimensions, making them a very flexible way to describe things that are too complex for scalars, vectors, and matrices. A simple way to understand a tensor is to think of it as a container that can hold scalars, vectors, and matrices in a way that can have many layers of depth.\n",

    "When you perform an operation like multiplication between tensors of different data types in PyTorch, such as a floating-point tensor (`float_32_tensor`) and an integer tensor (`int_32_tensor`), PyTorch automatically performs type promotion (also known as type casting) to ensure that the operation can proceed smoothly. Type promotion rules determine the data type of the result of an operation involving tensors of different types.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`float_32_tensor`**: This tensor is a floating-point data type, `torch.float32`. This data type represents 32-bit floating-point numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Operation**: When you multiply these tensors (`float_32_tensor * int_32_tensor`), PyTorch automatically promotes the integer tensor to a floating-point tensor so that the operation is between two tensors of the same type (floating-point). The rules for type promotion ensure that the operation does not result in unintended data loss. In this case, the result of the multiplication will be a floating-point tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type promotion is a feature designed to make tensor operations more intuitive and to prevent common mistakes that can occur when dealing with tensors of different data types. It allows for operations between tensors of different types by automatically converting them to a common type that is capable of representing the information in both tensors as accurately as possible."
